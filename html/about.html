		<h3>I have decided to change my live <br> by making 50 or even more web projects</h3>

		<p>One day I was thinking about myself and about my future career. What I can do to make it easier and have more time for
			me and my family?</p>

		<p>In the past I was studying Telecommunication at University of Technology in Wroclaw. During my studies I tried to start
			learning programming few times, unfortunately always gave up. I was waiting to change it long time. That day has come.
			Few weeks ago I bought 3 books about HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery. I started reading them one by one. In the meantime
			I was doing a lot of online courses and many tutorials. Of course you cannot start without basics so books are really
			useful, but to learn something, you need to practise. I started by creating website for my dad’s company. It was my first
			experience shock. I felt like a person who has never read anything about web development. Simply positioning was really
			hard, but every minute, every hour and every day it was better and better. Finally I finished my dad’s website after about
			one week.</p>

		  <p>After that I felt that I need to do something different. Something which will help me to learn more things. Something really helpful which show my skills and be my online CV. I was reading different blogs and than decided to make something similar, but also mine. I decided make 50 or even more different web projects. Every project will contain different topic, function and mechanism. After about 50 projects I hope I will know much more about web programing than before and will have enough knowledge to start some big professional projects.</p>

		  <p>We will see what future bring to me :)</p>
